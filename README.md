# Grasshopper-Waffle-Slicer
This Rhino Grasshopper script takes a Mesh, material thickness, and slice number as inputs and slices the volume along perpendicular axes, before nesting the slices in user-defined sheets for laser cutting or CNC machining, and giving a preview of the waffle structure. In addition to built-in grasshopper functions it uses BowerBird Waffle and OpenNest, both available on Food4Rhino.
